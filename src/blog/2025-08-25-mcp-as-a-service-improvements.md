We've completed a major infrastructure upgrade that makes MCP as a Service more reliable, faster, and easier to use than ever before.

## What's Better Now

### ðŸŽ¯ More Reliable
Your MCP instances are now much more stable. They automatically recover from any issues and maintain consistent performance. No more unexpected disconnections or service interruptions.

### âš¡ Faster Performance
Browser automation tasks now run more smoothly with better resource isolation. Each instance gets dedicated resources, so performance is consistent regardless of how many other users are on the platform.

### ðŸ”’ Better Security
Enhanced security with improved authentication and better isolation between instances. Your MCP sessions and VNC connections are now more secure than ever.

### ðŸ“± Easier to Use
Simplified URLs and better error handling make it easier to connect to your instances. The dashboard now shows real-time status and health information for all your MCP instances.

## What This Means for You

> To benefit from the new infrastructure, you'll need to create new MCP instances. Don't worry - it's still just a simple click in the dashboard.

Whether you're using MCP as a Service for:

- **AI Agent Development** â€“ More reliable browser control for your AI assistants
- **Testing & Automation** â€“ Stable Playwright sessions for your test suites
- **Remote Development** â€“ Consistent VNC access to your browser environments
- **Research & Scraping** â€“ Reliable data collection with better uptime

You'll experience fewer interruptions, better performance, and a more professional service quality.
